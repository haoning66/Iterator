Hi, this is README.

Environment: Mac OS 10.13.6  Haskell and Ocaml

This is an implement of two simple iterators in Haskell and Ocaml. In OCaml, I implement two iterators, map and fold, for each of the three data structures: a linked list, a tree, and a queue. In Haskell, two iterators, map and fold. In both languages, the map functions should map from an input data structure to an output data structure of the same type. The fold functions should take an initial value and return the result value.
